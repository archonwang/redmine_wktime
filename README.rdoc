= Time & Attendance
This Plugin provides the capability to submit Time, Expense and Attendance within redmine. The user must be a 
member of a project with permission to log time.  If the user has 'Edit time logs' permission, 
then he can manage other team member's Time & Expense as well.

for Expense Sheets and Wk Attendance model for attendances. New Time & Expense sheets can be entered using the link ‘New sheet’, 
new issues can be added to the Sheets using the ‘Add Row’ link. Users without Edit permissions cannot edit/delete time & expense entries.

The Time & Expense sheets can be approved/rejected by supervisors after it is submitted by Project Members.
Here is the workflow of Approval system..
i) In addition to the Save button there is also a submit button
ii) A team member can save a time & expense sheet any number of times, but can only submit once.
iii) Once a time & expense sheet is submitted, the user with "Approve time log" permission can approve / reject it.
In the mean time if he wants to take back his submission, he can unsubmit his time & expense sheet
iv) Once approved, the time & expense sheet can never be edited.
v) If the time & expense sheet is rejected, then it goes back to the project member for re-submission
   An email about the rejection is sent to the Project Member.
vi) Once approved, a time & expense sheet can be unapproved, it sends the time & expense sheet back to submitted state.
vii) If the timesheet is not submitted before deadline, then a email notification will be sent to the project member.

Time & Attendance plugin supports REST API. It supports both xml and json. Using the api we can list
time/expense sheets for a user, create, update and delete time/expense sheets.  User with approve time log 
permission can approve, unapprove, reject time/expense sheets. This plugin also supports code hooks.
